	<p>Progess is somewhat steady. I feel more hope with this template, as my understanding of these languages is
		steadily getting better with it's help. Before this, I was working on a sort of gallery-wall kind of webpage.
		I got the js script to click and drag things working, but it only worked with the first item that called for it's
		use. So that was a bit of a roadblock. I'll get back to it eventually. 
		<br>
		I've been missing the weather up north lately. <br>
		My body isn't fit for florida weather. I sweat too much, my face over-heats, and it's only gotten worse
		on my medication - which I can't just stop taking, it's for ADHD. I kinda can't take care of myself
		without it. lol. <br>
		Once I'm with a job, I want to move to the PNW. I desperately 
		miss the mountains and the forest. I grew up on the east coast in the appalachian but didn't really take
		advantage of it. I was a depressed mess in high school, quite the hermit. Now that things are so much better,
		I want to get outside and be active. That's not easy for me here. As beautiful as Florida can be, there's 
		a bit too much aside from just the weather that's pushing me away. I can't wait to move, I just know I belong
		somewhere north of here. <br>
		I'll get there someday. I just need to keep working hard to get there. <br>
