	<h2>why does this exist?</h2>
	<p>i've wanted to create a personal website that genuinely combines my love of art and coding together. i never
		got that with site providers that only provided limited templates. so i'm very excited to be creating with 
		neocities and to learn more about html, css, and js :D
